The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before it's fully loaded. This can happen if you use asynchronous operations without proper error handling or waiting for the promise to resolve. For example, if you directly access data from a query snapshot in a callback function that's called before the data is available, you'll encounter undefined values, resulting in unexpected behavior or runtime errors.
